# RC2014 informations

Basic Usage
A command line for compiling a C file or .lst file containing a simple list of mixed C and asm files can look complicated, but really it is pretty straight forward.

1 - Use a Makefile.

Makefile
--
all:
	zcc +rc2014 -subtype=basic -clib=sdcc_iy -o test.o test.c -SO3 -v -m -list -pragma-define:CRT_ORG_CODE=0x8500 -create-app

clean:
	rm -f test_DATA.bin test_BSS.bin test_CODE.bin test.map test.bin test.o test.hex test.ihx

--

2 - Change to the project folder

cd folder

3a - Compile using docker. run:

docker run -v ${PWD}:/src/ -it z88dk/z88dk make

(or build a file make.sh with that command (and any other we need), and just do: sh make.sh)

3b - Compile using an install from source

make
